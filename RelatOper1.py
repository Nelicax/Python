#These Relational Operators allows us to compare elements by returning a Boolean value.
v = 4
a = 5
c = 5

#The "==", is used to check if a value is equal to another value.

r1 = c == v
r2 = c == a
print ("c == v: "+str(r1))
print ("c == a: "+str(r2))

#The "!=", is used to check if a value is different to another value.

r3 = c != v
r4 = c != a
print ("c != v: "+str(r3))
print ("c != a: "+str(r4))

#Mathematical Relational Operators works in the same way for programming as they do on Math problem.

r5 = c<v
r6 = c>a
r7 = v<=a
r8 = a>=c

print ("c<v "+str(r5))
print ("c>a "+str(r6))
print ("v<=a "+str(r7))
print ("a>=c "+str(r8))
